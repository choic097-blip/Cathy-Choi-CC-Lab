    <h1>Extra</h1>

      A flexible space for reflections, inspirations, coursework, and anything meaningful.

    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a multidisciplinary creator working across games, comics, web, and narrative design. 
      I’m interested in how systems shape people, and how people quietly resist those systems through
      small choices, habits, and stories. Rather than aiming for polished perfection, 
      I focus on meaning, structure, and emotional logic. 
      I care about why something exists as much as how it looks or functions. 
      A lot of my work starts from discomfort or contradiction. 
      Ideas around normalcy, identity, labor, consent, and control show up repeatedly in what I make. 
      I’m drawn to interactive formats like games and interfaces because they allow me to explore
      power and agency in a way that static media cannot. Even when the tone is playful or minimal, 
      the underlying questions are often serious. I see design as a way to think through 
      complicated feelings rather than simplify them.
      
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Work</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of school, I work as a freelance artist and storyteller. 
      I create serialized comics, character-driven narratives, and visual assets for various projects. 
      Much of this work involves long-term planning, revisions, and collaboration, 
      which has shaped how I approach design responsibly and realistically. 
      I’m used to balancing creative intent with deadlines, feedback, and production constraints, 
      and that experience strongly informs my practice. 
      Across all of my work, I value clarity, intention, and honesty.
